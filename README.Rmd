# findretractions

## Installation

The `findretractions` package is a simple tool to help see if papers you have cited have associated retraction notices, erratums or expressions of concern. Currently, it can only find records on PubMed (using the `RISmed` package by Stephanie Kovalchik); future versions may expand to other databases as well. 

You can install the released version of findretractions using:

``` r
devtools::install_github("imaddowzimet/findretractions")
```

##How to use it

`check.bib()` is the main function in the package. It takes as an input any BibTex file (.bib); .bib files can be exported from almost every reference manager software (like Zotero or Endnote). To export a BibTex file from Zotero, just select the library or collection you want to export, select File>Export Library...(or if it's a collection, right click, and select Export Collection...), and choose the format "BibTex" in the pop-up window that appears:

![](Misc/zoteroexport.png)

Then just run `check.bib` with the link to the relevant file:

```{r}
library(findretractions)
check.bib("Misc/My Library.bib")

```

The function checks the references one by one, and is careful to not overload PubMed with too many requests, so it may take some time to run. It returns a list of any flagged articles, or an empty list if it hasn't found anything. 

**IMPORTANT**: This function is mean to flag *possible* retractions, erratums or expressions of concern. Any articles it flags should be checked on PubMed or the publisher's website directly, so that you can find the content of the notice, and be aware that it will not flag any notice not indexed on PubMed (and there are documented lags in when retraction notices get posted to PubMed; see [Decullier E et al., 2014](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=What+time-lag+for+a+retraction+search+on+PubMed%3F)). Right now, the [Retraction Watch Database](https://retractionwatch.com/2018/10/25/were-officially-launching-our-database-today-heres-what-you-need-to-know/) has the most up to date listings of retracted articles; unfortunately, as it doesn't yet have an API, articles need to be searched for manually on their site.
