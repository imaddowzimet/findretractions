# findretractions

## Installation

The `findretractions` package is a simple tool to help see if papers you have cited have associated retraction notices, erratums or expressions of concern. Currently, it can only find records on PubMed (using the `RISmed` package by Stephanie Kovalchik); future versions may expand to other databases as well. 

You can install the released version of findretractions using:

``` r
devtools::install_github("imaddowzimet/findretractions")
```

##How to use it

`check.bib()` is the main function in the package. It takes as an input any .bib file; .bib files can be exported from almost every reference manager software (like Zotero or Endnote). To export a .bib file from Zotero, just select the library you want to export, select File>Export Library..., and choose the format "BibTex" in the pop-up window that appears:
